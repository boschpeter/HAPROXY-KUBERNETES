Kubernetes manages containers across a fleet of servers, overseeing the fair usage of resources and hiding the low-level details of the servers themselves. It accelerates continuous delivery, makes it easy to build fault-tolerant applications, and supports on-demand scalability.

Above all, Kubernetes is extensible. Knowing that the platform would never support all functionality natively, its maintainers provide APIs, allowing third parties to build powerful add-ons that integrate seamlessly.
